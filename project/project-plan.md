# Project Plan

## Title
 Renewable Energy Adoption and CO2 Emissions Reduction

## Main Question
How does the adoption of renewable energy sources correlate with reductions in CO2 emissions, and what strategies can be implemented to further accelerate this transition?



## Description
This project aims to explore the relationship between the adoption of renewable energy sources and reductions in CO2 emissions. By analyzing datasets from the European Data Portal and GitHub's awesome-public-datasets related to renewable energy adoption and CO2 emissions, the project seeks to identify trends, quantify the impact of renewable energy adoption on CO2 emissions, and propose strategies to further accelerate this transition.
